This website is dedicated to the results of a two week project during the course Complex System Simulation at the University of Amsterdam in June 2018. In this limited time, we designed, implemented and analysed a _simple_ complex sytem. 

## Problem Setting
In this project, we simulated a Mars colony which is solely dependent on solar power for electricity generation. We represented houses or residential areas as nodes and placed them on various networks and cellular automata topologies to investigate the behaviour of the electrical grid. If a house consumes more than it can produce, it will reach an empty battery and becomes inactive due to power shortage. To make this more interesting, solar panel capacity is uniformly distributed. Now, what happens when the total consumption of the system equals its total production? Is sharing your energy with your neighbour a good idea, or is selfishness the best strategy?

The menu will guide you through the different topologies we used to simulate our electrical grids. There you will find all the results we obtained.

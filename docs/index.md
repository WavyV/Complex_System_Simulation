## Welcome to our project page for the course Complex System Simulation (June, 2018)

On this website, you will find all the effort we put into this project. Our aim was to model a complex system and analyse it, and so we did.

In this project, we simulated a mars colony which is solely dependent on solar power. We represented house or residential areas as nodes and placed them on various networks and cellular automata topologies to investigate the behaviour of the electrical grid. If a house consumes more than it can produce, it will reach an empty battery and is eliminated. To make this more interesting, solar panels are uniformly distributed. Now, what happens when the total consumption of the system equals its total production? Is sharing your energy with your neighbour a good idea, or is selfishness the best strategy?

The menu will guide you through the different topologies we used to simulate our electrical grids. There you will find all the results we obtained.

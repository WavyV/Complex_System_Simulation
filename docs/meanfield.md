# Approach

On this page we describe our approach of the model using an approximate mean-field. In this type of system a network is generated in which each node is connected to every other node. We consider two versions of this model: 

1. Each iteration each node produces energy according to the function: randint(0, a)
2. We simulate solar days where the sun intensity is given by A * sin(2 * pi * t) for t < 1/2 and 0 otherwise. 

So let's take a look at these versions. 

# Integer Version
The number of 








# Sine Version

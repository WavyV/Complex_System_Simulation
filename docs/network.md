On this page, we will describe our approach of the model which uses networks.  Specifically, we will investigate the influence of 5 network types:

- Fully connected (similar to mean field)
- Ring network
- [Random network](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RandomGraph.html)
- [Small-world network](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SmallWorldNetwork.html)
- [Scale-free network](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Scale-FreeNetwork.html)

# Approach



# Simulation settings

# Results
The results are presented below for two scenarios. Where the the each node survives and where there is a shortage of energy due to which a handful of nodes die.

## When everyone survives

## When energy is scarce and some die
